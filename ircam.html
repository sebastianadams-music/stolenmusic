    <h2>The first presentation of Stolen Music, at <a href="https://3537.org/" target="_blank">3537</a>, Paris</h2>
    <p>Stolen Music was originally conceived for my final project as part of the  <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/transmission/formations-superieures/cursus#la-promotion-202122" target="_blank">IRCAM Cursus</a>, and presented in <a href="https://3537.org/" target="_blank">3537</a> in Paris on 16th September 2022, but my interest in stealing material (often in morally dubious ways) goes back to at least 2012, with my pieces Tweet Piece #2 and CrowdScoreSing.</p>
    <p>This project owes a huge debt to <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/person/claudia-jane-scroccaro" target="_blank">Claudia Jane Scroccaro</a>, who was my main supervisor, as well as the whole pedagogy department at IRCAM, particularly Pierre Jodlowski, Sebasti√©n Naves and Jean Lochard - who all directly contributed to this project in important ways.</p>
    <p>The basic aim of the project is to explore two main ideas that matter to me:
        <ul>Examining the boundaries of a "piece" of music: questioning the idea of the sole author and finding ways to subvert the linear, sectional timeline of a typical musical performance (for example by creating transitions that merge multiple pieces by different composers in a way that introduces doubt about the start/end points and both foreshadows future material and references past events.</ul>
        <ul>Presenting an argument that all musical material should be fair game for all people to work with, regardless of who owns it under current copyright law.</ul>
    </p>
    <p>My contribution to this concert unfolded in and around the other pieces in the concert, which were by Julie Zhu, Aida Shirazi (in close collaboration with the dance artist Stefanie Inhelder), Qingqing Teng, and Filippos Sakagian. In this case, their material was taken and used with their blessing and they were consulted about my plans for it - however, this was done mainly because we are all friends and it wouldn't have been right to misuse their material in a concert which was of such importance to all of us. They are also all due a big thank you for their generosity in agreeing to let me work with their music in this context! In general, I have no qualms about going against the wishes of other composers (and I expect others to feel free to treat me in the same way). </p>

    <h3>PRE-CONCERT: FREED SOUNDS INSTRUMENT</h3>
    <p>As the audience entered the concert space, they were given an envelope with mysterious contents...</p>
    <img src="i/kazooenvelope.jpeg" alt="Kazoo in envelope">
    <p>
         They were also given a small card inserted into the programme notes which contained a QR code linking to this webpage:<br> <a href="freesounds.html"  target="_blank">Freed Sounds Instrument</a> <br>and including one or two small event pieces from a set of 32 <a href="s/EVENTS_FOR_FREED_SOUND_A6.pdf"  target="_blank">(linked here)</a>.</p><p>The audience were given the option of using this webpage while they waited for the concert to begin, and eventually it was shut off remotely right before the concert started properly.</p>

         </div>
        
    <p>    If you wish to reproduce the effect of this part of the concert, I would play this soundfile: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/BugInTheSYS/sounds/108605/"  target="_blank">event sounds</a> and then go on the <a href="freesounds.html" target="_blank">Freed Sounds Instrument</a> page in another tab and begin improvising with it.</p>

    <h3>FIRST PIECE: BOX, by Julie Zhu</h3>
    <p> This piece involved a percussionist (Olivia Martin) hidden inside a large wooden box, painted black and placed in the centre of the room. The percussionist made sounds using some percussion instruments (esp. bass drum, thundersheet) that were with her inside this claustrophic space, as well as drawing on the inside surfaces of the box. The contents of the box, as well as its surfaces, were amplified and spatialised across 12 loudspeakers (and two transducers attached to the thundersheet) in the room. The effect was to place the audience partly imagining being inside the box, and partly distorting the reality of the space inside and outside the box.</p><p>        Julie and the team decided to have the percussionist begin making sounds before the concert, while the Freed Sounds Improvisations were still going on, meaning that we had already weakened the clear boundaries around each piece by the time the concert began.</p>
    <h3>TRANSITION: Doors Into Worlds</h3>
    <h4>part one:</h4>


      <div class="video-container">
        <div class="video-frame">
            <div class="video">
            <!-- replace embed src with video embed URL -->
                <embed
            src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z038Tz6JZKo" 
            wmode="transparent"
            type="video/mp4"
            width="100%" height="100%"
            allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen
            ></div>
        </div>
        </div>
    
    <p>This video was projected on all four sides of the box used in Julie's piece. During the video, the percussionist opened the (previously invisible) door of the box and left it. The sonic material used is an array of YouTube videos of ASMR pen scratching (as I couldn't use material that was *really* from Julie's piece because all her material was processed live). The video part (obviously) is a bunch of clips of doors, mainly from famous films and TV shows. An additional element in the video is a Coke can, which was originally going to be a larger part of the project overall but even with its reduced role it makes sense to use such an iconic trademark. It also foreshadows a red colour palette for later on the concert.</p>
    <p>Because the box needed to move out of the centre of the room to allow space for the remaining pieces in the concert, I prepared a second video, which was projected onto the wall. This change happened seamlessly and once the audience's gaze had shifted, the production team began the process of safely moving this large box (which was on a platform with wheels) to the side of the hall, parting the audience as they went. This clip was designed to hold space, and it uses a looped clip of a scene from the film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0201538/" target="_blank">Les convoyeurs attendent</a>, with the contents behind a door chroma-keyed out and with all kinds of footage washily displayed behind it. When the production team had moved the box, the video fades down regardless of where in the video it is. </p>

    <h3 class="technology">Technology used in this section:</h3>
    
    <p class="technology">MUBU library for Max (for automated audio segmentation w/ onset-detection; and for real-time concatenative synthesis), Reaper DAW with various reverb settings: the audio part was made from loading in files, auto-segmenting them and then improvising with them laid out on a graph according to audio descriptors. The resulting tracks were then layered in Reaper and processed through different reverbs, aiming to achieve different spaces every time a door opened. The video is entirely fixed media and made in DaVinci Resolve, using the Fusion part of the software for chroma-keying some of the doors.</p>

    <h3>SECOND PIECE: N√© entre corps, by Aida Shirazi <br> with choreography by Stefanie Inhelder</h3>
    
    <p>The beautiful central visual idea of this piece was to place the choreographer behind a canvas screen and throwing her silhouette on the screen with lighting from behind. The simple idea became way more than the sum of its parts by combining the shadows thrown from multiple light sources to abstract the body of the dancer (who was otherwise augmented only by some hair extensions). Inhelder was often a purely geometric shape, but always hinting at her human body before eventually collapsing into a much more realistic silhouette towards the en of the piece.</p>
    <p>Shirazi's sound emerged from an exploration of a bilingual text (Persian/French, the poem of the title) which is only ever heard in fragments or cast through heavy processing. </p>
    <p>The combined movement and sound is very abstracted (especially to somebody who has limited French and no Persian), but the effect carries the weight of the text across and there's a heavy intensity to the piece</p>
    <p>At the end of this piece, the silent opening of the next transition appeared immediately on the closest projection screen to this piece's position in the room.</p>

    <h3>TRANSITION: Shadow Puppets</h3>
    <p>Looking for a visual link that could lighten the atmosphere without parodying or attacking Aida and Stefanie's work, I hit on the idea of using shadow puppets. I found a set of whimsical videos online and realised I could build a simple "love story" out of them, and also take advantage of their colouring to play some more tricks with transparency (hiding different images in the light and shadow portions of a rabbit, for example).</p>
    <p>A big preoccupation for me while working on these sections was that the tone of the pieces around my transitions was mostly dark, serious and intense. I wanted to try and find a way to freshen the audience up so that they were ready for another intense piece, without seeming to make fun of any of the pieces. It's a fun challenge to try and make short, playful work that still has a kind of weight or beauty of its own (whether I succeeded or not is up to others to say!) </p>
    <p>So the video here is predominantly shadow puppets, with some more "random" material creeping in which mostly foreshadows later sections. The audio is entirely derived from Aida's piece: she sent me the full audio stems (each of her sounds separately) of her piece and I was able to batch process them and use them in a kind of rudimentary musical instrument to create some improvisations. I created the video first and tried to create long tumbling  whispers tied to the gestures in the video.</p>
    <p>The piece was projected on the wall, and at the end of the transition, a separate projection of red fog came up on another screen and revealed the position of the performer for the next piece, which starts immediately. The red fog is designed to loop and then fade down when ready.</p>

    <h3>THIRD PIECE: Ghost shouting, Ghost screaming, by Qingqing Teng</h3>
    <p>This piece is for singer with a really crazy constricting costume. Qingqing has an amazing way of making super intense, loud, aggressive and bracing sounds and this piece is full of them! ADD MOR ETEXT</p>

    <p>The final sound of Qingqing's piece is this amazing jackhammerish pulse, and I used that as the start of my next transition. </p>
